            Welcome to Azima! our platform allows you to link your 360Â° images together to create a virtual tour that you can save and share!
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Our project started with <a href="https://www.mjhome.co.nz/">MJ Home </a>, a leading New Zealand real estate company. Through our editor
            application we were able to offer a solution that allows users to view and explore properties from the comfort of their homes</p>

            Beyond real estate our platform can also tranform any set of images into immersive virtual tours. Whether it be your airbnb, a retail store
            or the outdoors, Azima can do it all!
