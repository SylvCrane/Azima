# Azima
Azima is a web-based platform that allows users to upload 360° images and craft virtual tours. Users can name their tour, link images through portals, and decide on the tour’s visibility—public or private. Additional details about the tour can also be provided to enhance the viewing experience. To access all features of Azima, users must be registered by either creating an account or logging in.
